# Vocal Raid Assistant

Vocal Raid Assistant is deeply inspired by GladiatorlosSA and works as an audible announcer for what cooldowns and special abilities that are being used during PvE Encounters.

Example of such abilities: Tranquility, Rallying Cry, Divine Hymn, etc.

(Note: this has nothing to do with the bossmod VEM)

## Why use VRA?
It adds audio feedback about what cooldowns and spells are being used at the current moment.

## What will you hear?
It is completely up to you. VRA provides various config options to fit your needs. After installing, a default config is provided.

You can setup different configurations for various activities. E.g. Raid and Dungeon.

Multiple Voicepacks are available.
